0.6.10-8 -- 15/12/2014
- DBus: avoid escaping integer parameters when setting network parameters.
  That mainly concerns scan_ssid. But others parameters such as priority and
  frequency are impacted too.

0.6.10-7 -- 31/05/2013
- Vanilla Ralink drivers don't report signal information. In this case, we
  get scan results from the WEXT interface if available, and merge signal
  information into the original scan results. That should work with all Ralink
  drivers as long as they have support for the WEXT interface. That removes the
  need to change Ralink drivers. Besides, it's not even possible (or would be
  difficult) with some driver versions as scan results are directly generated
  by the firmware and passed as-is to the user space.

0.6.10-6 -- 22/11/2012
- Made signal information for Ralink driver optional.

0.6.10-1 -- 04/08/2010
- Updated to WPA Suppliant 0.6.10.
- Applied a patch from Ralink to add WPS support to the Ralink driver and fixed
  a few mistakes. WPS support does not work with the wext driver.
- Updated the DBus interface to be able to control WPS. Some parts have been
  backported from WPA Suppliant 0.7.2. Other parts were made from scratch.

0.6.3-1 -- 02/03/2010
- Fix non-quoted WEP and WPA_PSK keys
  => Apply wpa_supplicant-0.6.3-dbus_doesnt_quote_wep_key_and_wpa_psk.patch patch
- Add Extended network capabilities access through DBUS
  => Apply wpa_supplicant-0.6.3-dbus_provides_extended_network_capabilities.patch patch
